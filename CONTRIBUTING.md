## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9

### Setting Up the Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/questro.git
cd questro

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

npm run build

# Run tests (when available)
npm run test
```

### Project Structure

```
questro/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Core utilities (types, event emitter, storage)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ points/         # Points system module
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ badges/         # Badges system module
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ quests/         # Quests system module (planned)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ leaderboard/    # Leaderboard system module (planned)
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/           # Usage examples
â””â”€â”€ dist/               # Built files (generated)
```

### Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode, avoid `any` types
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/types
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier (runs automatically on save)
- **Linting**: Fix all ESLint warnings/errors before committing
- **Comments**: Keep code self-documenting, avoid obvious comments
- **Bundle Size**: Be mindful of dependencies (goal: <15KB gzipped)

### Commit Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Build process or tooling changes

Examples:

```bash
feat: add leaderboard system
fix: resolve points persistence issue
docs: update README with new examples
refactor: simplify badge unlock logic
```

### Adding a New Module

When adding a new gamification module (e.g., Quests, Leaderboard):

1. **Create module directory**:

   ```
   src/your-module/
   â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts        # TypeScript types and interfaces
   â”œâ”€â”€ service.ts      # Business logic implementation
   â”œâ”€â”€ context.tsx     # React context provider
   â”œâ”€â”€ use-*.ts        # Custom React hooks
   â”œâ”€â”€ components.tsx  # React components
   â””â”€â”€ index.ts        # Public exports
   ```

2. **Follow existing patterns**:
   - Use the same architecture as Points/Badges modules
   - Implement event emitter for state changes
   - Support pluggable storage adapters
   - Export through module index

3. **Update main exports**:
   - Add to `src/index.ts`
   - Add to `package.json` exports field
   - Update `tsup.config.ts` entry points

4. **Add examples**:
   - Create example in `examples/` directory
   - Update README with usage instructions

5. **Update documentation**:
   - Add API documentation to README
   - Update feature list
   - Add migration guide if needed

### Testing Guidelines

When tests are added to the project:

- Write unit tests for services and utilities
- Write integration tests for React components
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names

### Performance Considerations

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders (use `useMemo`, `useCallback`)
- Keep bundle size minimal (check with `npm run build`)
- Lazy load heavy features when possible
- Profile performance for large datasets

### Documentation

When adding new features:

- Update README.md with usage examples
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs (concise, not verbose)
- Include TypeScript types for better DX
- Add examples in `examples/` directory
